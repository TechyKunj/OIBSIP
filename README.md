- [Project 2: Unemployment Analysis](#project-2-unemployment-analysis)
- [Project 3: Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning](#project-3-sales-prediction-using-machine-learning)

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification

### Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Key Learnings

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Building and evaluating machine learning models
- Visualization of results

### Usage

To run this project, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

## Project 2: Unemployment Analysis

### Description

This project focuses on analyzing unemployment data, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to explore how the unemployment rate and other economic factors were affected by the pandemic.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Key Learnings

- Data exploration and visualization
- Correlation analysis between different economic indicators
- Insight generation from unemployment trends

### Usage

To visualize the unemployment data and analysis, run:

```bash
python unemployment_analysis.py
```

## Project 3: Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Description

In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate future sales based on various factors like advertising expenditure, target audience, and promotional platforms.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Key Learnings

- Building predictive models for sales forecasting
- Feature selection and importance analysis
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

### Usage

To run the sales prediction model, use the following command:

```bash
python sales_prediction.py
```

## Conclusion

These projects provided valuable hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to real-world problems. They helped strengthen my understanding of machine learning, data analysis, and the importance of data-driven decision-making in business.
